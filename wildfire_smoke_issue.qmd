The Regions of BC highlighted on the map are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next `r params$smokeDuration`.

`r params$customMessage`

During a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour.

Monitor the situation for any wildfires near your area at [EmergencyInfoBC](https://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/). Follow all emergency announcements relevant to your location.

The next update will be available on `r format(as.Date(params$nextUpdate), '%B %d, %Y')` and made available on the Province's [Air Quality Warnings webpage](https://aqwarnings.gov.bc.ca/).

![A description of region(s) included in this Air Quality Warning is provided at the end of this warning. This Air Quality Warning excludes the area managed by Metro Vancouver. Refer to the More Information section for a link to air quality notifications issued by Metro Vancouver.](`r map`){fig-alt="Air Quality Warning - Wildfire Smoke Regions for `r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')`: `r region`." width="100%" height="600px"}

## Actions you can take
As smoke levels increase, health risks increase. Limit time outdoors. Consider reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.

People more likely to be negatively impacted by outdoor air pollution should reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors or seek medical attention if experiencing symptoms. This includes people aged 65 and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and people who work outdoors.

## During smoky conditions

::: {.content-visible when-format="markdown"}

{{< accordion_controls >}}

{{< accordion_start title="Follow your common sense" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

:::

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.

-   Carry any rescue medications with you at all times.

-   Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.

::: {.content-visible when-format="markdown"}

{{< accordion_end >}}

{{< accordion_start title="Monitor your symptoms" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

:::

-   Different people have different responses to smoke.

-   Mild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.

-   More serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains or severe cough.

-   People with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any personal care plans designed with their family physicians.

-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.

-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.

::: {.content-visible when-format="markdown"}

{{< accordion_end >}}

{{< accordion_start title="Tips to reduce your smoke exposure" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

:::

-   Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.

-   When indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.

-   When there is an extreme heat event occurring with poor air quality, prioritize keeping cool.

-   Protect your indoor air from wildfire smoke. Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. 

-   If you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to the fine particles in the smoke. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.

-   Check on others who are in your care or live nearby who may be more likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke.

-   Always follow guidance from local authorities.
