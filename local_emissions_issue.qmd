Exposure to `r pollutantExpansion` is particularly a concern for infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.

  cat(
    "Open burning restrictions are now in effect ", params$customMessageBanArea,
    " No new fires may be initiated, and no additional material may be added to existing fires. For more information on burning restrictions, refer to the Mandatory Emission Reduction Actions section below.",

Visit the provincial [air quality data webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality) for real-time observations.

`r params$customMessage`

The next update will be on `r format(as.Date(params$nextUpdate), "%B %d, %Y")` and posted to the province’s [Air Quality Warnings webpage](https://www.gov.bc.ca/airquality).

# Actions you can take

As air contaminant levels increase, health risks increase. Consider reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.

People more likely to be negatively impacted by outdoor air pollution should reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors or seek medical attention if experiencing symptoms. This includes people aged 65 and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and people who work outdoors.

## Follow your common sense

- Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

if (current_month %in% 6:8) {
  cat("- During warm weather, stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\n")
}
```

- Always carry any rescue medications with you.
- Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.

## Monitor your symptoms

- Different people have different responses to elevated levels of air contaminants.
- Mild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually disappear when the air contaminants return to typical levels.
- More serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains or severe cough.
- People with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any personal care plans designed with their family physicians.
- If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.
- If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.

## Tips to reduce your exposure to air pollution

- Air contaminant levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.
- When indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

if (current_month %in% 6:8) {
  cat("- When there is an extreme heat event occurring with poor air quality, prioritize keeping cool.\n")
}

if (params$pollutant %in% c("PM25", "PM10", "PM25 & PM10")) {
  cat(
    "- Protect your indoor air from outdoor air pollution. Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. Do-it-yourself air cleaners may also be used if other options are not available. For details, visit: https://rb.gy/epi7qv.\n",
    "- If you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to particulate matter. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\n"
  )
}

if (params$pollutant == "PM10") {
  cat("- Avoid busy roadways.\n")
}

if (params$pollutant == "PM25" && current_month %in% 6:8) {
  cat("-  Avoid roads with heavy vehicle traffic.\n")
}

if (params$pollutant %in% c("PM25", "PM10", "PM25 & PM10") && current_month %in% c(9:12, 1:5)) {
  cat("-  Avoid roads with heavy vehicle traffic and areas with wood smoke.\n")
