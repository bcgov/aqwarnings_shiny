### Getting Started

Here is high-level documentation on the development of applications, use of GitHub, and Openshift in the Government of BC:

- ["Working in github.com/bcgov" Cheatsheet](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Cheatsheet.md)
- [DevHub DC Developer guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/)

### Running the application in local development environment

Instructions are geared toward the following tools:

- [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

1. Ensure R, RStudio, and Quarto are installed on the machine
1. Clone this repository using GitHub Desktop
1. Open project in RStudio
1. Install required packages 
    Run `source("src/run_app_locally/install_packages.r")` in the console or select "Run" from RStudio's Source Pane
1. Make and required changes
1. Run the app locally to review
    Run `shiny::runApp()` or select "Run App" from RStudio's Source Pane

### Deploying

To deploy to TEST and PROD you require a shinyapps.io account.

1. Install rsconnect.
    - Before deploying for the first time, you need to ensure you have the rsconnect R package from CRAN installed. Run the following command in your R console to check:
    `library(rsconnect)`
    - If you get an Error that says “there is no package called ‘rsconnect’, try to install it the usual way:
    `install.packages(rsconnect)`

1. Configure rsconnect with your shinyapps.io token.
    Follow the [shinyapps.io instructions](https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/guide/getting_started/#configure-rsconnect) to copy your token from the account page and configure it in the R console:
    `rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name="<ACCOUNT>", token="<TOKEN>", secret="<SECRET>")`

1. Publish the app.
    - Run `deployApp()` or select "Publish" from RStudio's Source Pane with either the `ui.R` or `server.R` file open.
    - Fill in all the required details in the dialog box, noting them for future reference:
        - On the left side, choose which files to publish (or not publish)
        - On the right side, ensure you have the correct account selected
        - Enter a name that is at least 4 alphanumeric characters (no spaces). the name will be part of the URL to access your app, for example: `https://<ACCOUNT>.shinyapps.io/<APPNAME>`
    - For PROD the app name is `aqwarnings_shiny`, we publish new apps for major test versions following the convention `aqwarnings_shiny_test_<date>`.

1. Set up athentication for the app. (Note: you only have to do this when publishing a **new app**)
    - Go to the [shinyapps.io dashboard](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/dashboard). 
    - Navigate to the administrative interface, select the application to modify, and click on the Users tab. - Follow [the instructions](https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/guide/authentication_and_user_management/) to change the Application Visibility setting to "**Private**" and restart the app.
