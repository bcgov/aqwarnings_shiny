:::

The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Northern
Health Authority has issued a Pollution Prevention Notice within due to
elevated fine particulate matter.

Open burning restrictions are now in effect within . No new fires may be
initiated, and no additional material may be added to existing fires.
For more information on burning restrictions, refer to the Mandatory
Emission Reduction Actions section below.

Exposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for
infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as
asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections,
and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical
conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous
exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such
as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of
breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care
provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.

The next update will be on September 28, 2025 and posted to the
province's [Air Quality Warnings
webpage](https://www.gov.bc.ca/airquality).

Visit the provincial [air quality data
webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality)
for real-time observations.

## Actions you can take

As air contaminant levels increase, health risks increase. Consider
reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.

People more likely to be negatively impacted by outdoor air pollution
should reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors or seek
medical attention if experiencing symptoms. This includes people aged 65
and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with
an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and
people who work outdoors.

{{< accordion_controls >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Follow your common sense" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes
    uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Always carry any rescue medications with you.

-   Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves
    follow the same advice.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Monitor your symptoms" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Different people have different responses to elevated levels of air
    contaminants.
-   Mild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat
    irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually
    disappear when the air contaminants return to typical levels.
-   More serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains
    or severe cough.
-   People with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any
    personal care plans designed with their family physicians.
-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC
    at 8-1-1.
-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or
    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in
    clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical
    emergency, call 9-1-1.

{{< accordion_start title="Tips to reduce your exposure to air pollution" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Air contaminant levels may be lower indoors but will still be
    elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.

-   When indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.

-   Protect your indoor air from outdoor air pollution. Actions can
    include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation
    system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine
    particles. Do-it-yourself air cleaners may also be used if other
    options are unavailable. For more details, see the BC Centre of
    Control [fact
    sheet](https://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/Documents/Guidelines%20and%20Forms/Guidelines%20and%20Manuals/Health-Environment/BCCDC_WildFire_FactSheet_BoxFanAirFilters.pdf).

-   If you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting
    and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified
    N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to
    particulate matter. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can
    still be risks to health.

## Emission reduction actions

{{< accordion_start title="Mandatory actions" initiallyOpen="true" >}} -
NOTICE of DIRECTOR under s.30 Open Burning Smoke Control Regulation:

> As pollution is occurring or is likely to occur from open burning,
> pursuant to Sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the Open Burning Smoke Control
> Regulation, the Director has prohibited open burning within until
> September 28, 2025 12:00 PM local time. No vegetative debris may be
> ignited or added to ignited piles. Contravention of these provisions
> may be subject to a fine under the Regulation.

{{< accordion_start title="Voluntary actions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Avoid using wood stoves and fireplaces unless it is the sole heating
    source. If wood burning is the sole heating source, burn dry,
    seasoned wood and ensure an adequate supply of combustion air.
-   Avoid backyard burning.
-   Reduce vehicle use where possible and avoid idling vehicles.

## More information

{{< accordion_start title="Current conditions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

Fine particulate matter refers to airborne solid or liquid droplets with
diameters of 2.5 micrometers (μm) or less. PM~2.5~ levels tend to be
highest around busy roads, industrial operations and neighbourhoods with
residential wood burning. PM~2.5~ can easily penetrate indoors because
of their small size. Common sources of PM~2.5~ that contribute to
episodes of poor air quality vary seasonally but can include wood smoke
(from wood stoves and/or open burning) as well as emissions from
industry and transportation sources such as automobiles, trucks and rail
traffic.

The provincial air quality objective for PM~2.5~ is 25 micrograms per
cubic metre (μg/m^3^) averaged over 24 hours. 24-hour average PM~2.5~
concentrations are summarized below for and nearest monitored
communities at local time today:

  Community                     Burns Lake   Vanderhoof
  ----------------------------- ------------ ------------
  24-hr average (μg/m^3^)       5.3          13.5
  Max. within 24 hr (μg/m^3^)   23.9         26.0
